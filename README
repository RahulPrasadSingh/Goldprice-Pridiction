Data Collection and Preprocessing: The model uses historical gold price data and relevant financial indicators (e.g., stock market indices, interest rates) as input features. Data is cleaned, normalized, and split into training and test sets.
Random Forest Model: A Random Forest regression model is employed, which constructs multiple decision trees during training. Each tree predicts gold prices based on different subsets of the data and features, ensuring diversity in predictions.
Model Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on the training dataset, with each tree contributing to the overall prediction through averaging. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test dataset.
Prediction and Insights: Once trained, the model can predict future gold prices based on new input data. The Random Forest's ensemble approach helps in reducing overfitting and provides more reliable predictions.
